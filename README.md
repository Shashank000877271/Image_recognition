# Emotion detection using deep learning

## Introduction

This project aims to classify the emotion on a person's face into one of **seven categories**, using deep convolutional neural networks.

## Dependencies

* Python 3, [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/), [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)
* To install the required packages, run `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
* The repository is currently compatible with `tensorflow-2.0` and makes use of the Keras API using the `tensorflow.keras` library.
